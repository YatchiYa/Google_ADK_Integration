# ReAct Planner Guide for Google ADK

## Overview

The **ReAct (Reasoning, Acting, Observing) Planner** is a structured approach to AI agent planning that follows a specific methodology:

1. **PLANNING** - Create a detailed step-by-step plan
2. **ACTION** - Execute planned actions using available tools  
3. **REASONING** - Explain reasoning and observations
4. **FINAL_ANSWER** - Provide comprehensive final response

## ðŸ§  **Streaming Issue Resolution Summary**

### **Problem Identified**
Your streaming was showing **duplicate content** - individual chunks followed by a massive final accumulated response. This happened because:

1. **Google ADK Behavior**: ADK sends incremental chunks during generation, then a final complete response
2. **Missing Duplicate Detection**: Your `StreamingHandler` wasn't filtering out the duplicate final response
3. **Result**: Users saw content twice - once as streaming chunks, then again as one large block

### **Solution Implemented**
Added duplicate detection logic in `StreamingHandler.start_streaming_session()`:

```python
# Track accumulated content to prevent duplicates
self._accumulated_content: Dict[str, str] = {}

# In content processing:
current_accumulated = self._accumulated_content[session_id]

# Skip large chunks that duplicate accumulated content
if len(part.text) > 1000 and current_accumulated and part.text.strip() == current_accumulated.strip():
    logger.debug(f"Skipping duplicate final response for session {session_id}")
    continue

# Update accumulated content for tracking
self._accumulated_content[session_id] += part.text
```

### **Result**
âœ… **Clean streaming** - No more duplicate final responses  
âœ… **Efficient bandwidth** - Reduced from 32 to 24 events in your test  
âœ… **Better UX** - Smooth streaming without content repetition

## ðŸŽ¯ **ReAct Planner Implementation**

### **1. PlanReActPlanner**

For models without built-in thinking (like `gemini-2.0-flash`):

```python
from google.adk import Agent
from google.adk.planners import PlanReActPlanner

# Create planner
planner = PlanReActPlanner()

# Create agent with planner
agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    planner=planner,
    instruction="""Follow ReAct methodology:
    
    /*PLANNING*/
    Create detailed step-by-step plan
    
    /*ACTION*/
    Execute planned actions using tools
    
    /*REASONING*/
    Explain reasoning and observations
    
    /*FINAL_ANSWER*/
    Provide comprehensive final answer
    """,
    tools=[your_tools_here]
)
```

### **2. BuiltInPlanner**

For models with built-in thinking (like `gemini-2.5-flash`):

```python
from google.adk import Agent
from google.adk.planners import BuiltInPlanner
from google.genai.types import ThinkingConfig

# Configure thinking
thinking_config = ThinkingConfig(
    include_thoughts=True,    # Include model's internal reasoning
    thinking_budget=1024      # Limit thinking tokens
)

# Create planner
planner = BuiltInPlanner(thinking_config=thinking_config)

# Create agent with planner
agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    planner=planner,
    tools=[your_tools_here]
)
```

## ðŸ“‹ **ReAct Output Structure**

When using `PlanReActPlanner`, the agent's response follows this format:

```
[user]: Research AI market trends and create investment strategy

[agent]: /*PLANNING*/
1. Search for latest AI market trends and news
2. Analyze market size and growth projections  
3. Identify key players and technologies
4. Calculate potential ROI scenarios
5. Create comprehensive investment recommendations

/*ACTION*/
[Tool calls and executions happen here]

/*REASONING*/
Based on the search results, I found that the AI market is experiencing rapid growth with a CAGR of 35%. Key insights include:
- Healthcare AI showing strongest growth (45% CAGR)
- Enterprise AI adoption accelerating post-2024
- Regulatory clarity improving investor confidence

/*FINAL_ANSWER*/
Here's your comprehensive AI investment strategy:
[Detailed recommendations based on research and analysis]
```

## ðŸ”§ **Integration with Your Agent Manager**

Your `AgentManager` already supports planners! Use the `planner` parameter:

```python
# Via API
{
    "name": "Strategic Planner Agent",
    "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
    "planner": "PlanReActPlanner",  # or "BuiltInPlanner"
    "tools": ["google_search", "custom_calculator", "text_analyzer"],
    "instructions": "Use structured ReAct methodology..."
}

# Via Python
agent_id = agent_manager.create_agent(
    name="Strategic Planner",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
    planner="PlanReActPlanner",
    tools=["google_search", "custom_calculator"],
    persona=AgentPersona(
        name="Strategic Planner",
        description="Uses ReAct methodology for complex planning"
    )
)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Best Practices**

### **When to Use ReAct Planners**

1. **Complex Multi-Step Tasks** - Market research, strategic planning, analysis
2. **Tool-Heavy Workflows** - Tasks requiring multiple tool calls and reasoning
3. **Structured Thinking** - When you need clear reasoning trails
4. **Decision Making** - Investment analysis, business strategy, technical planning

### **Planner Selection Guide**

| Model Type | Recommended Planner | Use Case |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | `BuiltInPlanner` | Built-in thinking capabilities |
| `gemini-2.0-flash` | `PlanReActPlanner` | Structured external planning |
| Other models | `PlanReActPlanner` | Universal structured approach |

### **Optimization Tips**

1. **Clear Instructions** - Specify the ReAct format in agent instructions
2. **Appropriate Tools** - Provide tools that support the planning workflow
3. **Thinking Budget** - For BuiltInPlanner, set reasonable thinking_budget (256-1024 tokens)
4. **Structured Prompts** - Design prompts that encourage planning behavior

## ðŸš€ **Testing Your ReAct Agents**

Your test suite now includes ReAct planner testing:

```bash
# Test ReAct planner agent
cd /home/yarab/Bureau/perso/jinxai/Google_ADK_Integration/backend/test_simple_agents
./test_react_planner_agent.sh
```

This demonstrates:
- âœ… Structured planning methodology
- âœ… Multi-step reasoning and execution  
- âœ… Complex problem solving with tools
- âœ… Strategic analysis and synthesis
- âœ… Memory integration for insights

## ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Benefits**

ReAct planners provide:

2. **Improved Accuracy** - Structured approach reduces errors
3. **Transparency** - Visible planning and reasoning steps
4. **Consistency** - Repeatable methodology across tasks
5. **Tool Optimization** - More strategic tool usage
