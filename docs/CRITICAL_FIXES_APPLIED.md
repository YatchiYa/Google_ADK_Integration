# Critical Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fix 1: Added Missing `update_agent` Method to DatabaseService

**Problem**: Tool attach/detach was failing with error:
```
'DatabaseService' object has no attribute 'update_agent'
```

**Solution**: Added `update_agent()` method to `/backend/services/database_service.py`

**Method**:
```python
def update_agent(self, agent_id: str, updates: dict) -> bool:
    """Update agent fields in database"""
    # Updates any agent field dynamically
    # Returns True on success
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Tool attach/detach now works

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix 2: Streaming Tool Issue

**Problem**: 
- Created agent with `call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian_streaming`
- Agent says "I do not have access to external tools"
- Tool is registered but ADK doesn't recognize it

**Root Cause**: 
Google ADK doesn't support custom streaming tools. The `StreamingToolWrapper` class we created is not compatible with ADK's tool system. ADK expects:
- Functions decorated with `@tool`
- `BaseTool` subclasses with specific methods
- Built-in ADK tools

Our `StreamingToolWrapper` doesn't match ADK's expectations.

**Current Behavior**:
```python
# Tool is registered
streaming_rag_tool = StreamingToolWrapper(
    streaming_func=call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian_streaming,
    tool_name="call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian_streaming",
    tool_description="..."
)

# But ADK doesn't recognize it as a valid tool
# Agent receives empty tools list
```

**Solution Options**:

### Option A: Use Non-Streaming Version (RECOMMENDED)
Use `call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian` instead of the streaming version.

**Pros**:
- Works immediately
- Fully compatible with ADK
- Tool is already registered and working

**Cons**:
- No real-time streaming
- User waits for full response

### Option B: Convert to ADK-Compatible Tool
Modify the tool to use ADK's `@tool` decorator:

```python
from google.adk.tools import tool

@tool
def call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian_streaming(
    query: str,
    mode: str = "global",
    user_prompt: str = "expert in laws retrieving"
) -> str:
    """
    Search Algerian Civil Code using RAG with streaming.
    
    Args:
        query: Search query
        mode: Search mode (global/specific)
        user_prompt: User expertise level
        
    Returns:
        str: Search results
    """
    # Collect all chunks
    chunks = []
    for chunk in _internal_streaming_function(query, mode, user_prompt):
        chunks.append(chunk)
    
    # Return complete result
    return "".join(chunks)
```

**Pros**:
- ADK compatible
- Tool will be recognized
- Can still stream internally

**Cons**:
- ADK still waits for full result
- No real-time streaming to user

### Option C: Direct SSE Endpoint (COMPLEX)
Create separate streaming endpoint that bypasses ADK:

```python
@router.post("/api/v1/tools/stream/rag")
async def stream_rag_tool(query: str):
    async def generate():
        for chunk in call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian_streaming(query):
            yield f"data: {json.dumps({'chunk': chunk})}\n\n"
    
    return StreamingResponse(generate(), media_type="text/event-stream")
```

**Pros**:
- True streaming
- Works independently

**Cons**:
- Separate from agent flow
- Complex integration
- User experience fragmented

## üéØ Recommended Action

**Use the non-streaming version for now**:

1. When creating agents, use: `call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian`
2. This tool is fully functional and ADK-compatible
3. It provides complete, accurate results
4. No streaming, but reliable

**Why**:
- ADK's architecture doesn't support streaming tools
- The non-streaming version works perfectly
- Streaming would require major ADK modifications
- The tool still provides fast, accurate results

---

## üìù How to Use

### Create Agent with RAG Tool:
```json
{
  "name": "Legal Expert",
  "tools": ["call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian"],
  "persona": {
    "description": "Expert in Algerian civil law"
  }
}
```

### Agent Will Have Access:
- ‚úÖ Tool is recognized by ADK
- ‚úÖ Agent can call the tool
- ‚úÖ Results are accurate and complete
- ‚ùå No real-time streaming (ADK limitation)

---

## üîç Verification

### Test Tool Attach:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/tools/attach \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool_names": ["call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian"]}'
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully attached tools..."
}
```

### Test Agent with Tool:
Ask agent: "What are the property rights in Algerian law?"

Expected: Agent uses the tool and provides legal information.
