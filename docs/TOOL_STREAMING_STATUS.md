# Tool Streaming - Current Status

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### 1. Streaming Tool Function
**File**: `/backend/tools/google_adk_tools.py`

Created `call_document_rag_code_civile_algerian_streaming()` that yields chunks as they arrive from the external API.

### 2. StreamingToolWrapper Class
**File**: `/backend/tools/google_adk_tools.py`

Created a wrapper that makes generator functions compatible with ADK BaseTool interface.

### 3. Tool Registration
**File**: `/backend/managers/tool_manager.py`

Registered both versions - original and streaming with metadata flag.

### 4. New Event Type
**File**: `/backend/managers/streaming_handler.py`

Added `TOOL_STREAM_CHUNK` event type for streaming tool results.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Core Challenge

### Google ADK Architecture Limitation

The tool DOES stream from the external API, but Google ADK's Runner class:
- Executes tools synchronously
- Waits for the complete result
- Doesn't forward partial chunks
- Returns everything as a single response

**Result**: User still sees the full response at once, not streaming.

## üîß Next Steps Required

### Option A: Custom Tool Execution Hook (Recommended)
Intercept tool execution before ADK processes it and stream chunks directly to frontend.

### Option B: Direct SSE Endpoint (Alternative)
Bypass ADK for streaming tools using Server-Sent Events.
